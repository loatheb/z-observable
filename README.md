### How to contribute

##### commit message
commit message style should like:

```
operate(scope): some detail about your operation.
```

here are some operation, and the descreption about when to use it.

* init: build project structure, should appear at the beginner of the project.
* feat: the main feature code, like a new functional thing will be added.
* fix: fix a bug or typo.
* chore: the things may be done for several times, like changing version.
* refactor: refactor an API or a breaking change.
* tweak: same with refactor but the level is lower than it, like changing the UI and rewrite a function in another way.
